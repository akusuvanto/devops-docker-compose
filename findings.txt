Based on the results of this exercise and other findings while completing the 
tasks, containers can share some things with the host and also isolate on many 
aspects. 

Containers can share the network stack if using the 'host' network mode, while 
using a bridge provides some isolation. 

Containers isolate running processes from the host.

Based on the results given by programs, containers can see the host's disk 
and an overlay file system, however based on documentation, without a mount 
or running in privileged mode, the container should not have access to files 
on the host device. Containers also create multiple isolated tmpf filesystems 
that are stored only in memory.

The uptime reported by the container is the same as the host, since they share 
the OS kernel.
